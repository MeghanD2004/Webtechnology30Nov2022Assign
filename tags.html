    <h1> <centre> Bengaluru City </centre> </h1>
    
    <div class="a"> <p> <b> Bengaluru is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Karnataka.</b> It has a population of more than <i> 8 million and a metropolitan population of around
      11 million </i>, making it the third most populous city and fifth most populous urban agglomeration in India, as well as the <b> <u> largest city in South India</u> </b>,
      and the 27th largest city in the world. Bangalore has a pleasant climate throughout the year, with its parks and green spaces earning it the reputation as the
      <b> "Garden City" of India </b>. </p> </div>
    
    <div class="a"> <p> The city's history dates back to around 890 CE, as found in a stone inscription found at the <b> <i> Nageshwara Temple </i> </b> in Begur, Bangalore.
      In 1537 CE, Kempe Gowda – a feudal ruler under the <b> Vijayanagara Empire </b> – established a mud fort, considered the foundation of modern Bangalore and its oldest areas,
      or petes, which still exist. After the fall of the <b> Vijayanagar empire </b> , Kempe Gowda declared independence; in 1638, a large Adil Shahi Bijapur army defeated
      Kempe Gowda III, and Bangalore was given to them as a jagir (feudal estate).The Mughals later captured Bangalore and sold it to <b> Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar </b>,
      the then ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. When Haider Ali seized control of the Kingdom of Mysore, the administration of Bangalore passed into his hands. </p> </div>
    
    <div class="a"> <p> Bangalore's topography is <b> generally flat </b>, although the western parts of the city are hilly. The highest point is <b> <u> Vidyaranyapura Doddabettahalli </u>
      </b> , 962 m (3,156 ft) above sea level, situated to the northwest of the city. No major rivers run through the city, although the <i> Arkavathi and South Pennar </i>
      cross paths at the <i> Nandi Hills </i>, 60 km (37 mi) to the north. River Vrishabhavathi, a minor tributary of the Arkavathi, arises within the city at <b>
      Basavanagudi </b> and flows through the city. </p> </div>
    
    <div class="a"> <p> Bangalore has a <b> tropical savanna climate </b> with distinct wet and dry seasons. Due to its high elevation, Bangalore usually enjoys a more moderate climate
      throughout the year, although occasional heat waves can make summer somewhat uncomfortable. The coolest month is January with an average low temperature of 15.1 °C
      (59.2 °F) and the hottest month is April with an average high of 35 °C (95 °F). The highest temperature ever recorded in Bangalore is 39.2 °C (103 °F), recorded
      <i> 24 April 2016 </i>, corresponding with the strong El Niño in that year. The lowest ever recorded is 7.8 °C (46 °F) in <i> January 1884 </i> .Winter temperatures
      rarely drop below 14 °C (57 °F), and summer temperatures seldom exceed 36 °C (97 °F). Bangalore receives rainfall from both the northeast and the southwest monsoons,
      and the wettest months is September, followed by October and August. The summer heat is moderated by fairly frequent thunderstorms, which occasionally cause power
      outages and local flooding. Most of the rainfall occurs during the late afternoon or evening and rain before noon is infrequent. </p> </div>
    
    <div class="a"> <p> The <u> official language</u> of Bangalore is <b> Kannada </b>, spoken by 42.05% of the population. The second-largest language is Tamil, spoken by 16.34% of the
      population. 13.73% speak Telugu, 13.00% Urdu, 4.64% Hindi, 3.16% Malayalam and 2.05% have Marathi as their first language. Other major languages in the
      city include Konkani, Marwari, Tulu, Odia and Gujarati. The Kannada language spoken in Bangalore is a form called as 'Old Mysuru Kannada' which is also used in most of
      the southern part of Karnataka. A vernacular dialect of this, known as Bangalore Kannada, is spoken among the youth in Bangalore and the adjoining Mysore regions.
      English is extensively spoken and is the principal language of the professional and business class. </p> </div>
